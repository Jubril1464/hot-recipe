# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

## Dependecies used : 
Redux, React-Redux, Redux-logger
SASS 
React-spinner
React-Router-dom - used for navigation

### REDUX
The Redux was used for managing the the app state(the liked recipe state).
## The Redux-logger  i used redux_logger to replay Redux actions + state , network requests, console logs and so on
The Redux-middleware allows developer to intercept every action sent to the reducer so you can make changes to the action or cancel it .
For more on it : https://react-redux.js.org

### SASS
SASS (Syntactically awesome style sheet) - is an extension of CSS that enables developers to use things like varaible, nested rule, inline import and more.
The media query of this app was written with the power of SASS which is the the mixin and include
### REACT-ROUTER-DOM
I used react-router-dom to implement dynamic routing in the web app. it allows the user to display and navigate them. The version used is V6

## NOTE : 
If there is error 402 or 401, that means you have exceeded the maximum request given by the API owner
so you can either pay for the API or create a new account at : https://spoonacular.com/food-api
After that there is a file named APIKEY at the src folder, change the apikey to the new generated one
### To install all dependencies run npm install or yarn in your CMD or Terminal 
### After installing dependencies, run npm start to start the react app
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
